# 54-Day Novena App - Session Progress Report

## Session Overview
**Date**: September 16, 2025
**Duration**: Extended session focusing on bug fixes and UI improvements
**Primary Focus**: Resolved critical intention loop bug and improved dark mode contrast

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. âœ… Fixed Critical Intention Loop Bug
**Problem**: Users were getting stuck in an infinite loop when setting intentions for novenas (both regular and recommendation-started novenas).

**Root Cause**: The `createSteps()` function in `NovenaModal.tsx` was conditionally adding an intention step to the prayer steps array, causing the steps to change dynamically during renders and confusing the navigation logic.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed intention step from the main prayer steps array entirely
- Intention setting now handled exclusively through separate `PrePrayerIntention` modal
- Simplified step creation logic for consistent prayer flow
- Updated navigation button logic to remove intention step handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/modals/NovenaModal.tsx` - Core fix implemented

**Impact**: Users can now complete novenas without getting stuck in intention loops.

### 2. âœ… Improved Dark Mode Color Contrast
**Problem**: Light colors like "gold", "pink", "brown" had poor contrast with white text in dark mode, making novena interfaces hard to read.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced generic color names with proper hex color codes
- Used Tailwind color palette at 600-800 levels for optimal contrast
- Ensured all novena types have distinct, accessible colors

**Color Updates Made**:
```
Divine Mercy:     red â†’ #dc2626 (red-600)
Sacred Heart:     gold â†’ #d97706 (amber-600)
St. Joseph:       brown â†’ #92400e (amber-800)
Immaculate Heart: blue â†’ #2563eb (blue-600)
St. ThÃ©rÃ¨se:      pink â†’ #db2777 (pink-600)
St. Jude:         green â†’ #16a34a (green-600)
St. Anthony:      brown â†’ #a16207 (yellow-700)
Blessed Mother:   blue â†’ #1d4ed8 (blue-700)
Holy Spirit:      red â†’ #b91c1c (red-700)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/constants/novenas.ts` - Updated all novena color definitions

**Impact**: Much better readability in dark mode across all novena interfaces.
