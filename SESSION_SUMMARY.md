### 📚 **Key Files Modified This Session:**
- `src/components/modals/SettingsModal.tsx` - Complete dark mode overhaul
- `src/components/modals/PrayerModal.tsx` - Full dark mode implementation  
- `src/components/common/ExpandablePrayer.tsx` - Dark mode theming
- `src/utils/notifications.ts` - Cleaned up, mobile-aware, desktop-only
- `PATCHNOTES.md` - Updated with v0.2.0 features and improvements
- `STRATEGY.md` - Updated status and notification approach
- `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` - Comprehensive project overview (NEW)

### 🎨 **Design System Consistency:**
- **Colors**: Consistent gray-800/700/600 backgrounds, gray-200/300 text in dark mode
- **Transitions**: All use `duration-300` for smooth theme switching
- **Borders**: `dark:border-gray-600` throughout for subtle separation
- **Interactive**: Proper hover states and focus indicators in both themes
- **Typography**: Maintained hierarchy with proper contrast ratios

### 💡 **Key Technical Decisions Made:**
1. **Mobile notifications**: Hidden until Capacitor migration (user-friendly approach)
2. **Platform detection**: `shouldShowNotifications()` guards all notification features
3. **Dark mode pattern**: Consistent theming approach across all components
