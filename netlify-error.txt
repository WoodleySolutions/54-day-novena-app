The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to errors treated as warnings in the ESLint configuration, specifically related to unused variables in `src/App.tsx`.

**Solution:**
1. Open the file `src/App.tsx` in your project.
2. Address the unused variables at the mentioned lines (52, 60, and 71).
3. You can either remove the variables or use them in your code.
4. After resolving the issues, commit the changes to your repository and trigger a new build.
