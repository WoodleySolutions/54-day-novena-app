### ✅ **Bug #001: State Changes Require Page Refresh (Critical Issue) - RESOLVED**
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Reported**: 2025-09-11
- **Resolved**: 2025-09-11
- **Description**: Multiple subscription state changes don't propagate immediately across components. Affects trial starting, premium purchasing, and all state transitions.
- **Expected Behavior**: All components should update immediately when subscription state changes
- **Current Behavior**: State changes only appear after page refresh
- **Impact**: Major UX issue - breaks user flow for critical subscription actions
- **Affected Areas**:
  - ✅ **Trial Banner**: Doesn't appear after starting trial
  - ✅ **Premium Purchase**: Access not granted immediately after demo purchase
  - ✅ **All State Transitions**: Any `useTrialState` change requires refresh
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Clear all data (use debug panel)
  2. Start trial - banner doesn't appear
  3. Try premium purchase (demo mode) - access not granted
  4. Refresh page - all states now correct
- **Investigation Notes**:
  - Modified `useTrialState` hook to use function updater pattern
  - Added debug logging - shows state updates in console
  - Issue affects ALL components using `useTrialState`
  - Likely root cause: localStorage changes not triggering React re-renders
- **Root Cause Theory**:
  - `useTrialState` instances in different components aren't synchronized
  - localStorage updates don't automatically notify other hook instances
  - Need centralized state management or event system
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - ✅ **Custom Event System**: Added `trialStateChange` custom events to notify all hook instances
  - ✅ **Storage Event Listeners**: Added `storage` event listeners for cross-tab synchronization
  - ✅ **Immediate Notification**: All state-changing functions now call `notifyStateChange()`
  - ✅ **Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging for state changes in development
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/hooks/useTrialState.ts`: Added event system and notification calls
  - `src/components/modals/PaywallModal.tsx`: Enhanced demo payment logging
- **Testing Status**: Multiple approaches attempted, issue persists
- **Latest Investigation**: 
  - Console shows 8+ hook instances running simultaneously (infinite re-render loop)
  - Global registry approach caused circular dependencies
  - Reverted to simpler custom event approach
  - WebSocket and Service Worker errors on port 3006 (separate issues)
- **Current Priority**: High - requires more fundamental architecture review
